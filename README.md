# Quantum Computing (Teleportation) with PennyLane

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with quantum computing exercises specially for Quantum Teleportation using PennyLane and Python. These exercises are based on the PennyLane Coding Challenges and cover various quantum computing concepts.

## Contents

The notebooks in this repository cover the following topics:

1. Expectation Values
2. Multi-qubit Systems
3. Entanglement
4. Quantum Teleportation

Each notebook includes detailed information and preparation instructions for the exercises.

## Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- PennyLane
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yousuftomal/quantum-teleportation.git
   cd quantum-computing-exercises
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
